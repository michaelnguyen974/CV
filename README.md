## Michael Nguyen
I am an ambitious and team-orientated Full Stack Junior Developer, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to business analytics. 

After teaching for a year in Cambridge, I spent a few months privately tutoring to discover what my real interests were and , and thus I decided to embark on a journey to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. My experience at Makers Academy allowed to engineer the best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.
