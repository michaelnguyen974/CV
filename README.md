An alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), I'm a **full-stack Software Engineer** currently honing my craft at [Spektrix](https://www.spektrix.com/). With a technical academic background and an unconventional job history, it's led me to the world of coding — a craft which I find myself more excited with as time elapses. 

# Background

Graduating from university in 2012, the following years led me in various paths — from the freedom granted to travel the world through online poker to an office environment with a wide spectrum of responsibilities. At my last place of employment, I began figuring out how to automate monotonous tasks to make my coworkers and my own life easier. An enjoyable experience, that was the catalyst into taking that skill-set further — thus beginning my journey in programming.

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [CodeCraft](https://github.com/KTSE-2018/KTSE) | Completely indoctrinated by the course, my final project group created a bootcamp survival simulation game. Wanting to learn how to build it from the ground up, we didn't use any game frameworks and used TDD to build our own game logic. | 2 weeks | JavaScript, JQuery, HTML/CSS, Heroku | Mocha, Chai, Sinon |
| [PinkFish (Facebook)](https://github.com/Hemesh-Unka/acebook-pinkFish) | Five rag tag individuals band together and set off to create our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group. The site's design was driven by a plush toy of a pink fish found close to our desk. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku, AWS S3 Bucket | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, CodeClimate, Selenium-Webdriver (using headless Chrome) |
| [Tasteless Notes](https://github.com/vivianallen/tastelessnotes) | A group of four christened 'The Tasteless Sheep' create a notes SPA - the caveat being we weren't allowed to use any frameworks. If we wanted to employ TDD, we had to build the test framework ourselves.  | 1 week |HTML/CSS, JavaScript | Tasteless Testing Suite  |

# Skills

### Clean code advocate

Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Exercising programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production. 

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.

### Adaptability

I consider myself a highly adaptive individual able to adjust based on the situation.

Once I arrived to start my placement year in China with Goldwind, I found out during my onboarding process that I wasn't suited for the role they needed. I asked my superior if there was a purpose I _could_ fill in the department. Noticing a communication issue with a different member of staff and an international intern, I inquired if it would be appropriate for me to take care of the English speaking staff and escalate if necessary. It turned out to be a fruitful endeavour, creating a role for myself where I could use the skills I had and providing relief for an understaffed IT team.

### Teamwork / Mediation

I'm a true believer of the mantra that a productive team is one that can maintain the ability to work through the highs and the lows.

For my first group project (recreating our rendition of AirBNB), we decided that the purpose of the week was to learn and to try to use new technologies. Morale fluctuated as we underestimated how difficult it would be to wrestle with these tech stacks. Running daily standups and retros, I ensured that our group kept our eyes on the objective we set when we started — our moods always better coming out of them than going in. I believe this helped us to keep focus of what we wanted out of the project whilst maintaining good group cohesion. Ultimately, at the end of the project, we came out deciding that we _did learn_ - hitting our objective.

### Attention to detail

I pride myself in ensuring that my craft is high quality and as error free as can be.

During my group project 'Tasteless Notes', we successfully built our own testing framework but couldn't figure out how to output our pass/fail messages. Initially, we managed to come up with a workaround — but the original issue still surfaced with each message. Combing through our codebase and searching online for information, I noticed we weren't `return`ing the messages; implicitly implied in Ruby, not so in JavaScript. Amending this small keyword displayed our test results beautifully and allowed us to progress with peace of mind knowing we'd tackled the problem correctly.
