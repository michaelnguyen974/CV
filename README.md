I am a Chemistry and Cambridge graduate with experience in teaching science., looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge and agile working capabilities.

After teaching for a year in Cambridge, I spent a few months trying out new hobbies such as travelling and tutoring to discover what I wanted out of a job and what I wanted to achieve and thus, decided to embark on a journey to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. My experience at Makers Academy allowed to engineer the best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. 

I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed and runs through the companies veins as a business. 

## Projects 
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|

## Skills

#### Communication and Team-Orientated 
I am strong team-player coupled with an adaptive mindset - meaning I can lead teams in conjuction with pairing and learning individually. I am natural at setting priorities as well as understanding team cohesion towards those priorities. I make sure all team-members feel valued, and ensure that the that problems get resolved efficiently

- During the final project at Makers, I gathered all members of the team and organised the stand-ups and retros, as well as leading the planning phases of the project. I always made sure to get feedback from all members on any feature of the project, and always considered how each member felt to raise the morale

- The communication skills I learned as a teacher allowed me to adapt the way I approached each member, whilst making sure that when we were working on features, everyone checked up on each other on which stage each memebr was at, and how they were getting on - something I consider to be of utmost importance as this keeps everyone well-informed and good practice for working in agile environments

- At Soham Village College, I worked on the science curriculum for GCSE students and this was implemented across all sciences

#### Analysis and Problem solving 
I am creative thinker, which allows me to think of multiple solutions to solving a given problem. My process for working through coding situations is incremental - meaning I take granular steps when using a particular method and rule out hypotheses

- In my chemistry degree, I had numerous individual projects where I had to utilise limited resources such as chemicals to gather all my results for a given chemical reaction, which enabled me to rationally analyse what my priorities were and how I could make key decisions to reach my goal

- I break down coding problems as granular as possible, using TDD, modelling and user stories

## Education

#### Makers Academy (26th November to 1st March)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD

- Outstanding 
- Kpop and Homerton society member

#### University of Reading (September 2014 to July 2017)

- Bsc Chemistry 
- 1st Class Honours

## Experience
**Thurston Community College** (January 2018 to July 2018)    
*Science teacher*
Taught tertiary sciences up to GCSE and Chemistry to A-level

- Helped develop the curriculum in the science department which was adapted to the new specifications set out by OfQual in the AQA syllabus. Suggested different strategies of teaching using the modern techniques of pedagogy.

- Presented pedagogical ideas in front of all teachers at the school, which was amassive achievement in terms of helping the school look at problems 

- Helped organise parent's evenings and lead feeedback to A-level students

- Responsible for leading lunch-time science sessions for students who are avid learners of science, by carrying out fun experiments whilst adhering to all safety standards.

**Soham Village College** (September 2017 to December 2017)  
*Science teacher*
Taught tertiary sciences up to GCSE

- Worked on the science curriculum for GCSE students and was in charge of marking mock papers and distrubution

- Taught students from year 7 to year 11 in biology, chemistry and physics. This included laboratory work and intensive planning in terms of the safety aspects in which a COSHH form had to be filled out at all times to ensure the chemicals were of a low enough concentration so that they could be handled by the students. 

- Helped organise parent's evenings and lead feeedback to GCSE students after school
